switchSim was a small app to showcase the need of a more refined logic to handle the toggle of the switch 

and why is ultimately not possible to allow an external operator to send a mqtt singnal to toggle it on or off

as there are many edge cases, and the will of the user must be respected, as is, if I am not home, I do not care of green energy excess

if I need a hot shower, I do not care the slightest of peak consumption or something
